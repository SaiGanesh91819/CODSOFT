  SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

This project aims to find the sentiment of the social media posts like comments or reviews or any other text posts .
I have categorized the sentiments of the posts into three categories namely POSITIVE , NEGATIVE and NEUTRAL . 
The project goes under the domani of Machine Learning and I also used Flask web framework for an interface of my project .

This project involved few steps ,mainly 
    1) Data set collection
    2) Data pre-processing - Removing special characters , Tokenization , Removing stopwords , Stemming and Lemmatization
    3) Feature extraction - Vectorization 
    4) Model selection
    5) Model development
    6) Accuracy metrics
    7) Model deployment
    8) Designing a basic webpage using html, css and javascript
    9) Creating an interface using Flask web framework .

This developed model is able to accept the user text input and is also able to return the sentiment of the input .
